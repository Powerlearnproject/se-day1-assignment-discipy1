Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high qulity software systems. it is important in the techonology industry in that it enables tech companies, bisinesses and other related industries to come up with high quality and cost effective software that meet the user's needs.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. there was the development of programming languages e.g. C and Fortran.
  2. software engineering was established as a discipline in the 1960s.
  3. then there was the advent of programming in the 1970s.
  4. rise of the agile methodoligies in the 2000s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
  design-creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
  implementation- writing code and vuilding software accirding to the design specifications
  testing- conducting various tests to ensure the software meets qulaity standards and functional requirements
  deployment- releasing the software o users and customers
  maintenance- providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall is the sequential approach with distinct phases. this methodology includes factors such as requiremnets and design. on the other hand, agile methodologies involve iterative and incremental approaches focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - writes codes and implements software solutions
  quality assurance engineer - ensures software are of high quality by designing and testing projects
  project manager - oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
integrated development environments (IDEs) enable comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing software e.g. Visal studio. VCS enable tracking of changes to source code and coordinating tasks among teams e.g. Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. changing environments - be adaptive
  2. tight deadlines- scedule your time well and be on time
  technical debt - avoid shortcuts
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is giving clear instructions and statements to AI models to get accurate and clear responses.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
